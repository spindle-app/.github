## [Spindle](https://spindle.app) is an end-to-end Decision Simulation platform for optimizing the ROI of business decisions without statistics or code. *[üåÄ We're hiring engineers!](mailto:join-our-team@spindle.app)*
 
  
*`Who?`* üëã We‚Äôre a seed-stage team of seasoned machine learning and business intelligence entrepreneurs passionate about analytics that enhance human cognition. Founded in September ‚Äô21 by engineers [Ryan Atallah](https://spindleapp.co/ryan-atallah) *(fmr. CTO of natural language query engine ClearGraph, acquired by Tableau)* and [Carson Kahn](https://spindleapp.co/carson-kahn) *(fmr. President & CTO of natural language analytics platform Brainspace AI, acquired by Reveal)*, Spindle is backed by Accel Partners *(Slack/Dropbox/Atlassian)*, Caffeinated Capital (*Airtable/Notion/IFTTT)*, and diverse Fortune 100 executives who share in our mission to help teams simulate the ROI of decisions before they make them. Register for exclusive sneak peeks, alpha testing, and more at [üåÄ¬†spindle.app](https://spindle.app), or [join our team](mailto:join-our-team@spindle.app).

*`Why?`* From routine spend optimizations, to game-changing new experiments, marketing leaders demand data-driven decisions. But when attribution or performance data don‚Äôt (and can‚Äôt!) tell the whole story, growth & demand teams are forced to bridge the gap with assumptions. Often brittle, stale, or even unfounded, those assumptions are the ‚Äúduct-tape-and-glue‚Äù of marketing spreadsheets everywhere ‚Äî clouding  ROI and hiding creative opportunities from view. But what if you could elevate the team‚Äôs assumptions, expertise, and models from the realm of fuzzy intuition to the realm of actionable data? What if you could simulate the ROI of marketing spend decisions before making them?

*`What?`* Enter üåÄ¬†Spindle, the lightning-fast ROI Simulation platform that makes intelligent marketing mix modeling, scenario recommendation, and collaborative planning a breeze. Spindle‚Äôs Decision Graph technology translates your hard-won human expertise into machine intelligence, alleviating the ‚Äúanalyst bottleneck‚Äù for data-driven growth, demand, and performance teams who demand every dollar is best-spent without missing creative opportunities along the way.

*`How?`* Much like your analysts & marketers, Spindle‚Äôs two parts work synergistically. First, the Model Layer makes it easier for analysts or marketing ops pros to collaboratively build & deploy models that capture the relationships between live/historical data, assumptions, decisions, and ROI, all without statistics or code. Meanwhile, the Explore Layer empowers marketers to replace guesses with informed choices, quickly compare scenario experiments, and automatically detect creative new opportunities. As Spindle‚Äôs pilot users will attest, keeping the team‚Äôs decision-making healthy, spend plans fresh, and strategies competitive has never been so easy: ‚ÄúWith Spindle, we can quickly allocate budget across each marketing program in a way that optimizes for cost-per-opportunity & increases ROI ‚Äî using whatever data we already have. It helps each team rapidly discover the optimal use of their dollars, and easily simulates ‚Äòvirtual budget increases‚Äô to guide our colleagues in Finance, Strategy, and Sales. For marketing ops, Spindle is a game-changer.‚Äù
