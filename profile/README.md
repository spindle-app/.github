## [Spindle](https://spindle.app) is an end-to-end Decision Simulation platform for optimizing the ROI of business decisions without statistics or code. *[🌀 We're hiring engineers!](mailto:join-our-team@spindle.app)*
 
  
*`Who?`* 👋 We’re a seed-stage team of seasoned machine learning and business intelligence entrepreneurs passionate about analytics that enhance human cognition. Founded in September ’21 by engineers [Ryan Atallah](https://spindleapp.co/ryan-atallah) *(fmr. CTO of natural language query engine ClearGraph, acquired by Tableau)* and [Carson Kahn](https://spindleapp.co/carson-kahn) *(fmr. President & CTO of natural language analytics platform Brainspace AI, acquired by Reveal)*, Spindle is backed by Accel Partners *(Slack/Dropbox/Atlassian)*, Caffeinated Capital (*Airtable/Notion/IFTTT)*, and diverse Fortune 100 executives who share our vision for a future where the highest form of productivity is creativity. Register for exclusive sneak peeks, alpha testing, and more at [🌀 spindle.app](https://spindle.app), or [join our team](mailto:join-our-team@spindle.app).

*`Why?`* From routine ROI optimizations, to game-changing new allocations, closed-loop marketing demands data-driven decisions. But when performance and attribution data don’t *(and can’t!)* tell the whole story, marketing & revenue teams are forced to bridge the gap with *assumptions*. They’re the “duct-tape-and-glue” of marketing spreadsheets everywhere: brittle, stale, or unfounded assumptions that make it hard to distinguish between good strategies and *great* strategies — denying marketing ops teams the intelligent planning & agile experimentation they deserve. But what if marketers could elevate their team’s assumptions, constraints, and models from the realm of “licked-finger intuition”*…* to the realm of *predictive data*?

*`What?`* Enter 🌀 Spindle, the end-to-end Decision Simulation platform that makes decision analytics, scenario recommendation, and collaborative planning for marketing a breeze. Spindle turns human intelligence into machine intelligence, alleviating the “analyst bottleneck” for data-driven revenue & marketing ops teams that demand every dollar is best-spent without missing growth opportunities on the way.

*`How?`* Much like analysts & marketers, Spindle’s two parts work synergistically. First, the Workbench makes it easier for analysts to collaboratively build & deploy models that capture the relationships between live/historical data, assumptions, decisions, and ROI. Meanwhile, the Testbed empowers marketers to replace guesses with informed choices, quickly compare scenario experiments, and automatically detect creative new opportunities. As Sipndle’s pilot users can attest, keeping a team’s models healthy, plans fresh, and strategies competitive has never been so easy: *“Spindle enables us to make data-driven decision-making a reflex.”*
